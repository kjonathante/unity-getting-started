```C#
//[access modifier] - [class] - [identifier]
public class Customer
{
   // Fields, properties, methods and events go here...
}
```
* The class keyword is preceded by the access level. 
  * Because public is used in this case, anyone can create instances of this class. 
  * The name of the class follows the class keyword. The name of the class must be a valid C# identifier name. 
* The remainder of the definition is the class body, where the behavior and data are defined. 
  * Fields, properties, methods, and events on a class are collectively referred to as class members.
